# Cohort Retention Analysis

This project focuses on conducting a **Cohort Retention Analysis** to understand customer behavior over time, using the *Online Retail* dataset. The analysis was performed using **SQL** for data cleaning and preparation, and visualized using **Power BI**.

## üìå Project Objectives

- Understand customer purchasing behavior over time.
- Analyze retention rates across different customer cohorts.
- Visualize patterns and trends to support business decision-making.
- Build a **Cohort Retention Dashboard** for interactive insights.

## üóÇ Methodology

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Cleaning and Preparation

- The dataset was first cleaned using **SQL**:
    - Removed invalid records (null CustomerID, negative quantity/price).
    - Deduplicated transactions.
    - Created a **Cohort Date** based on each customer's first purchase.
    - Created a **Cohort Index** to track retention by months since first purchase.

- Final cleaned dataset was exported to `Cohort Retention.csv` for visualization.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Cohort Analysis Logic

- **Cohort Date** = The month of first purchase per customer.
- **Cohort Index** = Number of months since first purchase.
- The retention matrix was built showing how many customers remained active over each cohort period.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Visualization in Power BI

- Built an **interactive dashboard** using:
    - Cohort Retention Table (Counts)
    - Cohort Retention Rate Matrix (% Retention)
    - Supporting visuals + Info panel

## üìà Insights & Findings

- The **retention rate** typically drops sharply after the first month.
- Only a small percentage of customers are retained after month 3 or 4.
- Certain **cohorts performed better**, suggesting opportunities to investigate what drove those higher retention rates.
- The company can use these insights to:
    - Improve customer onboarding experience.
    - Design targeted campaigns to boost early retention.
    - Focus on cohorts with better lifetime value.

## üìö What is a Cohort?

> A **cohort** is a group of users who share a common characteristic within a defined time period.  
In this case, cohorts are defined based on each customer's **first purchase month**.

**Cohort Retention Analysis** helps to analyze:
- How long customers stay engaged.
- The effectiveness of customer acquisition strategies.
- Patterns in customer lifecycle.
